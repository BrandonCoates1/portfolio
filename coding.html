                    This allows you to input morse code or English,<br>
                    which then translates either to English or morse code. <br>
                    <br>
                    I built this with python and learned how to use a <br>
                    dictionary. This allowed me to store the English alphabet <br>
                    into a key: value pair with the respective morse code. <br>
                    <br>
                    As you can see in the message() function, this checks what <br>
                    the user inputs and returns either true or false. <br>
                    <br>
                    The translate() function then creates a reversed dictionary <br>
                    (for use in translating morse code to English), takes the <br>
                    boolean of message() and translates to morse code if true, <br>
                    and to English if false: returning the list (trans) as a string.

                    This was created with python with another person. We had 1 week <br>
                    to complete the project. I worked on stuff like what you can see <br>
                    to the left. <br>
                    <br>
                    The function create_class() asks the user multiple questions to<br>
                    decideon what class the player gets. This then gets inputted into <br>
                    a class (class is like a blueprint). <br>
                    <br>
                    The story of the game is that you wake up in a rundown barn, and <br>
                    you decide where you want to go. You have 3 options, each option <br>
                    takes you through different paths, and leads to multiple endings. <br>
                    <br>
                    The game has turn based combat against a variety of different <br>
                    enemies, which has its' own randomised stats.

                    This was one of the first challenges I did when learning python. <br>
                    The challenge was to take a number between 40 and 4001, <br>
                    and return the smallest amount of £100, £50 and £20 notes <br>
                    the atm would dispense. <br>
                    <br>
                    first, it checks if the input is a valid number between 40 and 4001, <br>
                    then splits the number into each respective column [1000, 100, 10]. <br>
                    <br>
                    This is then run through the withdraw() function to do maths <br>
                    depending on the size of the list created earlier, and returns <br>
                    the smallest amount of each note. <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, it works but the code can definitely be refined to be <br>
                    more effective and efficient. That is one thing I would do <br>
                    differently, if I did it again.
