                    Erika Chiba is a character from a Japanese show called <br>
                    Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. <br>
                    <br>
                    This was drawn back in 2015, and was back when I was <br>
                    just starting to draw. I only did a 'neat' sketch of Erika <br>
                    Chiba, as she is probably my favorite character from <br>
                    the show. <br>
                    <br>
                    Back then, I definitely wasn't confident at all <br>
                    and only really did neat sketches, as I am pretty sure <br>
                    I didn't even know about line art. <br>
                    <br>
                    This drawing is definitely one of the ones that got me <br>
                    into art as my interest grew from the ones before this. <br>
                    I look at this now wanting to redraw it and see what that <br>
                    would look like now, and to compare each other to see if <br>
                    an improvement in my art has been made.

                    Tatsumi is the main character from a Japanese show called <br>
                    Akame ga Kill! <br>
                    <br>
                    This was done back in 2018, and was back when I quit art a <br>
                    few months in. I drew Tatsumi because I found this image <br>
                    from the show and I wanted to try and colour. <br>
                    <br>
                    I think this definitely looks unfinished in some areas but <br>
                    it was a good effort seeing as this is one of the first few <br>
                    art works I have done with colour. <br>
                    <br>
                    Looking back at this now, it makes me want to continue to <br>
                    develop my colouring skills, as too be honest, I have lost <br>
                    motivation to do any sort of colouring. I might even go back <br>
                    and re-do this.

            <div class="text_sasuke_sakura">
                <p>
                    Sasuke and Sakura are a married couple from a Japanese <br>
                    show called Naruto. <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm not sure when exactly this was done, but it was <br>
                    sometime in 2018. I drew this because Naruto is one <br>
                    of my favorite shows, and Sasuke and Sakura are <br>
                    characters I have never drawn before. <br>
                    <br>
                    I went for a merge of the 2 characters as I saw similar <br>
                    art works online. I also experimented with line <br>
                    thickness, which looking back now makes the art work <br>
                    look good, but with thinner lines it would look better. <br>
                    <br>
                    I also see now that the shading is undeveloped, and <br>
                    would look better if added more depth.
